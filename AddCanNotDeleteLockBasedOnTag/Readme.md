Under Construction
This policy will add enforce the CanNotDelete Lock, if the Tag matches.
Based on previous work by these github contributors :
  https://www.stefanroth.net/2020/02/03/azure-policy-audit-and-deploy-cannotdelete-lock-on-resource-group-based-on-tags/
  https://adinermie.com/using-azure-policy-to-audit-resource-group-resource-locks/
Modifications required to either are not clear yet, pending evaluation. I will add comments for my own clarification. We may be doing a "if not matches" for tag but TBD.
